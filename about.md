Hi, I'm Richard and I'm a Frontend Web Developer.

I work at tictoc Digital in Glasgow where we build and maintain websites for clients from a variety of sectors.

I live in Falkirk, Scotland with my wife, Claire.

Outside of work, I'm obsessed about food and drink. We travel the World seeking out the best restaurants and bars.

I (sometimes) post about our experiences in my food and drink blog, [Demanding Epicurean](https://demandingepicurean.co.uk).

I'm a homebrewer and love all things beer.

I also enjoy playing and watching football.

Please get in touch if you'd like to chat or have any questions.

Cheers üçª
